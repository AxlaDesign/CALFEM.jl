Differences between Matlab CALFEM and CALFEM.jl
###############################################

* In CALFEM, the ``Edof`` matrix has an index representing the element number. This has been removed.

* CALFEM made some unfortunate choices in how they set up their matrices for dofs and coordinates. Both Julia and MATLAB use `column major order`__ which means that memory is stored column by column. We therefore also want to store for example the dofs for an element in a column. The concrete effect of this is that the following matrices are transposed in `CALFEM.jl`: ``Edof``, ``Ex``, ``Ey``, ``Ez``, ``Dof``, ``Coord``. The dofs for element ``k`` is therefore computed by ``Edof[:, k]`` instead of like in MATLAB ``Edof(k, 2:end)``.

* Some functions in CALFEM can compute a quantity for many elements at a time. In JuAFEM, you need to loop over the elements and call the function on each separate element.
