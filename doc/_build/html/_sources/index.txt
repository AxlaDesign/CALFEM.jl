Differences between CALFEM and JuAFEM
#####################################

* In CALFEM, the `Edof` matrix has an index representing the element number. This is pretty useless and has been removed.

* CALFEM made some unfortunate choices in how they set up their matrices for dofs and coordinates. Both Julia and MATLAB use [column major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order) which means that memory is stored column by column. We therefore also want to store for example the dofs for an element in a column. The concrete effect of this is that the following matrices are transposed in JuAFEM: `Edof`, `Ex`, `Ey`, `Ez`, `Dof`, `Coord`. The dofs for element `k` is therefore computed by `Edof[:, k]` instead of like in MATLAB `Edof(k, 2:end)`.


* Some functions in CALFEM can compute a quantity for many elements at a time. In JuAFEM, you need to loop over the elements and call the function on each separate element.
